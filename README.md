An intelligent Wumpus World agent that navigates a grid of hazards and searches for gold under uncertainty. It perceives environmental cues—breezes near pits and stenches near the Wumpus—applies logical inference to deduce safe paths, and balances exploration with caution to avoid fatal encounters, demonstrating key AI concepts such as decision-making under uncertainty, logical reasoning, and informed search strategies.
