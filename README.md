The Wumpus World is a classic problem in artificial intelligence that involves designing an agent to navigate a grid-based environment filled with hazards, such as pits and a fearsome Wumpus while searching for gold. The agent must operate under uncertainty, leveraging logical reasoning and perception to make decisions in a partially observable world.

This project focuses on implementing an intelligent Wumpus World agent capable of:

- Perceiving environmental cues such as breezes (near pits) and stenches (near the Wumpus).
- Applying logical inference to deduce the safe path to the gold.
- Balancing exploration and caution to avoid fatal encounters.

The project highlights key AI concepts, including decision-making under uncertainty, logical reasoning, and search algorithms, providing a practical application of intelligent agent design in a challenging and dynamic environment.
